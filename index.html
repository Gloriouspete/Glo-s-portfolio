        <h1 class="professionally">Professionally,</h1>
        <p id="wide">As a UX designer with expertise in multiple 
          disciplines, I have spent the past two years honing my skills in ideation, design intricacies, and technical writing. My goal now is to apply this wealth of knowledge
           to industries that have yet to fully realize the benefits 
           of UX design.

          I believe that my diverse background, coupled with my 
          experience in the field, puts me in a unique position to 
          help businesses and organizations that may not have traditionally focused on UX design.
          By bringing my expertise to these industries, I can help 
          them create innovative and user-centered products and services that meet the needs of their customers.
          
          My passion for UX design has only grown stronger over time, and I am eager to continue exploring new challenges and opportunities in this field. I am confident that my skills and experience will allow me to make a meaningful impact on any project or team that I am a part of.</p>
          <h1 class="personally">Personally</h1>
          <p id="widd">
            I come from a typical working-class family in Nigeria, and I am proud to be a fourth-generation Nigerian. Despite not being financially rich, my parents instilled in me and my siblings a strong value for education, ensuring that we received the best education possible with the resources they had.

My fascination with technology began when I was a child and watched
 science fiction films, dreaming of becoming a hacker. At the time, 
 it seemed like an impossible dream, but my passion for technology never
  dwindled. That all changed when I discovered Google Grasshopper, 
  a coding bootcamp that allowed me to learn the skills I needed to become a programmer.

From there, my journey in technology has been a thrilling adventure.
 I have developed my skills and expanded my knowledge, always
  striving to improve myself and to keep pace with the ever-evolving
   world of tech.

Today, I am eager to collaborate with like-minded individuals on 
positive projects that can have a meaningful impact on the world. I believe that through technology, we can bring about positive change and make the world a better place for all.
